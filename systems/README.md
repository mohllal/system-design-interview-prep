# System Designs

This section provides an overview of practice problems and designs for real-life systems, along with my personal assessment of their complexity.

Please note that these notes are not comprehensive and do not cover everything about the mentioned system designs. Instead, they serve as a refresher or a collection of key points that I personally find important for each system design. For more in-depth information, please refer to the references section for each system design.
