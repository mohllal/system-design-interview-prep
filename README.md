# System Design Preparation

This repository contains my personal collection of notes and resources for preparing for system design interviews.

The repository is divided into three main sections:

1. [Fundamentals](./fundamentals/): contains notes on fundamental concepts of system design.
2. [Architecture](./architecture/): contains notes on important software architecture and design patterns.
3. [Systems](./systems/): contains practice problems and designs for real-life systems.

This repository is a personal collection of notes that I consider important and frequently reference. It is not intended to mimic other comprehensive repositories available elsewhere.

## Repositories

For more in-depth and extensive knowledge on system design interview preparation, I recommend checking out the following excellent resources:

- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- [System Design 101 by ByteByteGo](https://github.com/ByteByteGoHq/system-design-101)
- [System Design by Karan Pratap](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/system-design)
- [System Design by Neo Kim](https://github.com/systemdesign42/system-design)

## Papers

I also recommend reviewing these white papers as they provide valuable insights into the design and implementation of distributed scalable systems:

- [MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf)
