# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

Peer-to-peer networks are decentralized systems where each node (peer) acts as both client and server, sharing resources and roles.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[P2P Network] --> B[Pure P2P<br/>No Central Authority]
    A --> C[Hybrid P2P<br/>Super Peers]
    A --> D[Overlay P2P<br/>Virtual Network Layer]
    
    B --> E[Bitcoin Network<br/>Fully Decentralized]
    C --> F[Skype<br/>Super Nodes]
    D --> G[BitTorrent<br/>DHT Overlay]
```

**Core Characteristics**:

- **Decentralization**: No central authority or single point of control
- **Symmetry**: All peers have equal roles and capabilities
- **Resource Sharing**: Peers contribute and consume resources
- **Fault Tolerance**: Network survives individual peer failures

## Use Cases

- IPFS for decentralized web content
- Content delivery networks (CDNs)

**Communication Systems**

- P2P messaging applications
- Voice and video calling
- Decentralized social networks

**Blockchain & Cryptocurrency**

- Bitcoin and Ethereum networks
- Decentralized consensus mechanisms
- Distributed ledger technology

**Distributed Computing**

- Distributed rendering and processing
- Collaborative computing platforms

## P2P Network Architectures

### Pure P2P Networks

Completely decentralized with no central authority or servers.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Peer 1] <--> B[Peer 2]
    A <--> C[Peer 3]
    A <--> D[Peer 4]
    B <--> C
    B <--> D
    C <--> D
    
    E[Peer 5] <--> F[Peer 6]
    E <--> G[Peer 7]
    F <--> G
    
    A <--> E
    B <--> F
```

**Characteristics**:

- All peers have equal status and capabilities
- No single point of failure
- Self-organizing and self-healing
- Complete decentralization

**Examples**: Bitcoin network, Gnutella, Freenet

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Maximum fault tolerance and censorship resistance
- ✅ No central authority dependencies
- ❌ Difficult to bootstrap and discover peers
- ❌ Harder to implement and maintain

### Hybrid P2P Networks

Combine P2P architecture with some centralized elements for coordination.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Super Peer 1] --> B[Regular Peer 1]
    A --> C[Regular Peer 2]
    
    E[Super Peer 2] --> F[Regular Peer 3]
    E --> G[Regular Peer 4]
    E --> H[Regular Peer 5]
    
    A <--> E
```

**Characteristics**:

- Super peers act as coordinators and relay points
- Regular peers connect through super peers
- Centralized coordination with distributed execution
- Easier peer discovery and connection management

**Examples**: Skype, KaZaA, eMule

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Easier to implement and manage
- ✅ Better performance and reliability
- ✅ Simplified peer discovery
- ❌ Super peers become bottlenecks
- ❌ Less decentralized than pure P2P

### Overlay P2P Networks

Create virtual networks on top of existing infrastructure using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and routing algorithms.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Physical Network<br/>Internet] --> B[Overlay Network<br/>DHT Ring]
    
    B --> C[Node 1<br/>Hash: 0x1000]
    B --> D[Node 2<br/>Hash: 0x3000]
    B --> E[Node 3<br/>Hash: 0x5000]
    B --> F[Node 4<br/>Hash: 0x7000]
    
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> C
```

**Characteristics**:

- Virtual network layer on top of physical network
- Structured routing using Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)
- Efficient resource location and retrieval
- Scalable to millions of nodes

**Examples**: BitTorrent DHT, Chord, Kademlia, Pastry

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Highly scalable and efficient
- ✅ Predictable performance characteristics
- ✅ Structured resource location
- ❌ Complex routing algorithms
- ❌ Vulnerable to churn (frequent node joins/leaves)

## Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)

DHTs provide structured routing in P2P networks by mapping keys to responsible peers, enabling efficient resource location and storage.

### How DHTs Work

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Key: file123] --> B[Hash Function<br/>SHA-1]
    B --> C[Hash: 0x4A2B...]
    C --> D[Find Responsible Node<br/>Closest to Hash]
    D --> E[Node 0x4A00<br/>Stores file123]
```

**Concepts**:

- **Hash Function**: Maps keys to consistent hash values
- **Node ID**: Each peer has a unique identifier in the hash space
- **Responsibility**: Each node is responsible for keys closest to its ID
- **Routing**: Efficient algorithms to find the responsible node

### Popular DHT Algorithms

**Chord DHT**

- Circular hash space (ring topology)
- Each node maintains finger table for routing
- O(log N) lookup complexity
- Simple but requires maintenance of finger tables

**Kademlia DHT**

- XOR-based distance metric
- k-buckets for storing node information
- O(log N) lookup complexity
- Self-organizing and fault-tolerant

**Pastry DHT**

- Plaxton tree-based routing
- Leaf set and routing table
- O(log N) lookup complexity
- Locality-aware routing

### DHT Operations

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Node A
    participant B as Node B
    participant C as Node C (Responsible)
    
    A->>B: PUT(key, value)
    B->>C: Route to responsible node
    C->>C: Store (key, value)
    C->>A: Success
    
    A->>B: GET(key)
    B->>C: Route to responsible node
    C->>A: Return value
    
    Note over A,C: O(log N) routing hops
```

**Operations**:

- **PUT(key, value)**: Store data at responsible node
- **GET(key)**: Retrieve data from responsible node
- **JOIN**: New node joins the network
- **LEAVE**: Node gracefully leaves the network

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Scalable to millions of nodes
- ✅ Fault-tolerant and self-healing
- ✅ Decentralized and distributed
- ✅ Predictable performance (O(log N))

**Challenges**:

- ❌ Complex routing algorithms
- ❌ Vulnerable to churn (frequent joins/leaves)
- ❌ Security concerns (Sybil attacks)
- ❌ Maintenance overhead

## Gossip Protocol

Gossip protocol is a decentralized communication mechanism where nodes periodically exchange information with randomly selected peers.

It is used to enable efficient information dissemination across large distributed systems.

### How Gossip Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Node A
    participant B as Node B
    participant C as Node C
    participant D as Node D
    
    Note over A,D: Round 1
    A->>B: Gossip message
    A->>C: Gossip message
    
    Note over A,D: Round 2
    B->>C: Forward message
    B->>D: Forward message
    C->>D: Forward message
    
    Note over A,D: Round 3
    D->>A: Forward message
    
    Note over A,D: All nodes have the message
```

**Key Principles**:

- **Random Selection**: Each node randomly selects peers to communicate with
- **Periodic Exchange**: Information exchange happens at regular intervals
- **Epidemic Spreading**: Information spreads like an epidemic through the network
- **Eventual Consistency**: All nodes eventually receive the information

### Gossip Algorithm Phases

**1. Information Dissemination**

- Node has new information
- Select random peers
- Send information to selected peers
- Peers receive and process information
- Peers update their state
- Peers become new disseminators

**2. Random Peer Selection**

- Each node maintains a list of known peers
- Randomly selects subset of peers for each gossip round
- Ensures uniform distribution of information
- Prevents hotspots and bottlenecks

**3. Convergence Process**

- Information spreads exponentially through the network
- Convergence time: O(log N) where N is network size
- High probability that all nodes receive the information
- Self-healing and fault-tolerant

**4. Failure Detection**

- Nodes share membership lists during gossip
- Track last-seen timestamps for each peer
- Declare peers as failed after timeout period
- Propagate failure information through gossip

### Gossip Protocol Types

**Anti-Entropy Gossip**

- Nodes exchange their entire state
- Ensures eventual consistency
- Higher bandwidth usage
- Used for database replication

**Rumor Mongering**

- Nodes only gossip about new information
- More efficient bandwidth usage
- Information may be lost if not gossiped quickly
- Used for event dissemination

**Hybrid Approaches**

- Combine anti-entropy and rumor mongering
- Balance between efficiency and reliability
- Adaptive based on network conditions

### Gossip Protocol Trade-offs

**When to Use Gossip**:

- Large-scale distributed systems
- High fault tolerance requirements
- Eventually consistent systems
- Dynamic network topologies

**When to Avoid Gossip**:

- Strong consistency requirements
- Bandwidth-constrained environments
- Small, stable networks
- Real-time systems with strict latency requirements
