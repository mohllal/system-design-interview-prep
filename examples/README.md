# System Design Examples

This section provides practice problems and designs for real-world systems. Each example includes key architectural decisions, trade-offs, and implementation considerations.

## üìù Thought Process

- **Clarify Requirements**: Ask about scale, features, and constraints
- **Use Back-of-the-Envelope**: Estimate capacity and resource requirements
- **Start Simple**: Begin with a basic design and iterate
- **Discuss Trade-offs**: Explain the pros and cons of your design choices
