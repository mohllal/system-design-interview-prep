# Availability

Availability measures the percentage of time that a particular service or component is in an opertional state.

Reliability measures the probability that the system will meet defined performance standards in performing its intended function during a specified interval.

## High availability (HA)

High availability (HA) is a system characteristic that aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher-than-normal period, typically five nines or more.

## Nines

Availability is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year.

A simple mnemonic rule is that 5 nines allow approximately 5 minutes of downtime per year. Variants can be derived by multiplying or dividing by 10: 4 nines is 50 minutes and 3 nines is 500 minutes. In the opposite direction, 6 nines are 0.5 minutes (30 sec) and 7 nines are 3 seconds.

| Availability %       | Downtime per year |
| -------------------- |:-----------------:|
| 90% (one nine)       | 36.53 days        |
| 99% (two nines)      | 3.65 days         |
| 99.9% (three nines)  | 8.77 hours        |
| 99.99% (four nines)  | 52.6 minutes      |
| 99.999% (five nines) | 5.3 minutes       |
